# Installation

* Clone the repo to your desired location
* Check if you already have `installed_paths` set by running `phpcs --config-show`

#### Example output

```
$> phpcs --config-show
installed_paths: /home/wpcs
```

## Set your installed standards path(s).

```
phpcs --config-set installed_paths /home/WDS-Coding-Standards/WebDevStudios,/home/wpcs
```

## WordPress Coding Standards

If you already had an installed path, just add that with a comma. Note that
the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards)
should be installed in separately and included in your `installed_paths`. We
simply add WebDevStudios standards in _addition_ to WPCS.

## Confirm your installation is complete

```
$ phpcs -i
The installed coding standards are PSR1, Squiz, MySource, PSR2, Zend, PEAR, PHPCS, WebDevStudios, WordPress-Core, WordPress-VIP, WordPress-Extra, WordPress-Docs and WordPress
```

> Full list of [Configuration Options](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Configuration-Options) over at the PHP_CodeSniffer wiki.

You should, at this point, be able to `phpcs --standard=WebDevStudios` and set
`WebDevStudios` as your standard in your favorite editors.

# Changelog

## 1.1

- Added WDS rules for `@return` `@since` and `@author`

## 1.0.1

- Changed `WebDevStudios-phpcs` to just `WebDevStudios` for compatibility with namespaces and new sniffs added later [#12](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/WDS-Coding-Standards/pull/12)
- Inclusion of the `WordPress-Docs` ruleset

Note, this release breaks some things. When you update to this version,
you will need to update your coding standard to `WebDevStudios` vs the old
`WebDevStudios-phpcs` which should no longer work.

## 1.0

- Initial ruleset based on WordPress-Extra
